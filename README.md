## HTML Development

The website was developed with a basic, modern design in mind. The website is a single-page site that has a modern sleek design. Using a combination of flat colours, the modern-looking square design with no curves, and a full-page-width design has allowed a website that is not only easy to navigate, but also extremely basic and easy to use. Content is easily available to read without annoying popups and having to wait for images to load.

## Javascript Development

## User Testng

A thorough test was conducted to ensure that the website in question was easy to use on both an iPhone 7, iPad Air, a Laptop and a Desktop Computer.

A test was conducted using 4 different individuals. Each individual was given access to the website on each of the devices shown above. The 4 individuals were then asked to write down their comments on the site on a peice of paper, whether they were positive or negative.

### Individual 1:

	= Website looks nice
	- Works well on phone
	- Buttons are easy to click
	- Colour combination is a little difficult to see. *This has now been addressed with the change of colour contrast.

### Individual 2:

	- Looks ok
	- Strange that the page doesn't move
	- Looks modern

### Individual 3:

	- Mobile menu is easy to use
	- Looks modern
	- Would like font to be bigger *User was visually challenged, so in this case making the font larger would be better for usage, but would compromise design.

### Individual 4:

	- iPad version of the website is easy to use
	- Loads fast
	- Looks cool
