## User Testng

A thorough test was conducted to ensure that the website in question was easy to use on both an iPhone 7, iPad Air, a Laptop and a Desktop Computer.

A test was conducted using 4 different individuals. Each individual was given access to the website on each of the devices shown above. The 4 individuals were then asked to write down their comments on the site on a peice of paper, whether they were positive or negative.

### Individual 1:

	= Website looks nice
	- Works well on phone
	- Buttons are easy to click
	- Colour combination is a little difficult to see. *This has now been addressed with the change of colour contrast.

### Individual 2:

	- Looks ok
	- Strange that the page doesn't move
	- Looks modern

### Individual 3:

	- Mobile menu is easy to use
	- Looks modern
	- Would like font to be bigger *User was visually challenged, so in this case making the font larger would be better for usage, but would compromise design.

### Individual 4:

	- iPad version of the website is easy to use
	- Loads fast
	- Looks cool
